            <p>
                Hello everyone ! My name is Mitchio, I'm japanese-luxembourgish and a physics graduate. My main contributions were the stats page, the login/register and the admin dashboards. I was also assigned as the project leader and took care of ensuring a nice workflow by assigning the tasks, using sprint backlogs on trello.</p>

            <h2>Joanna Wong </h2>
            <p>Hello world! I oversaw the database design and execution process. I helped write the code that connects our website to our Database and added various security features on different levels of the data structure to the website to manage Access Permissions to our features and overall Data Security.

            <h2>Eduardo Pinto</h2>
            <p>Hi, I'm Eduardo. My main focus in the project was to define a way to include a responsive news feed to the main page which displays the most recent events about Covid-19 pandemic. Then I've created a profile page, that gets and sends user info into the database, and improved the original navigation bar with some new links and routes. Finally I created a responsive footer with social networking interaction.</p>
